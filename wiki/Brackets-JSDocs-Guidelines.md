Brackets uses [Google Closure Compiler Annotation format](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler) for API Documentation.

The API Docs for the current master branch can be found at [http://brackets.io/docs/current](http://brackets.io/docs/current).

## Guidelines

### Header Comments

Header comments can _not_ have an empty line between end of comment and module definition:

```
/**
 * Header comment
 */
define(function (require, exports, module) {
```

Explicitly add an empty line for comments that should _not_ appear in API Doc:

```
/*jslint vars: true, plusplus: true, devel: true, nomen: true, indent: 4 */
/*global define, $, brackets, window */

define(function (require, exports, module) {
```

**Note:** previous example is a bug in apify dox parser â€” only comments starting with "/**" should be recognized.

Description should be __first__, followed by any `@tag` annotations. Descriptions following a `@tag` are associated with that `@tag`.

### Markdown Formatting

Markdown formatting is supported, so it will be reflected in the API Docs.

### Exceptions

Only code with JSDoc annotations will show up in the API Docs, with the following exceptions:

## Generating Documents

The [apify nodejs app](http://github.com/jbalsas/apify) is used to generate the Brackets API Docs.

If you have the apify app installed, then you can use the [Brackets Apify extension](http://github.com/jbalsas/brackets-apify) to generate API Documentation on-the-fly for your local branch.

The [Grunt Apify app](https://github.com/jbalsas/grunt-apify) is for automating the generation of API Docs.

See the [Generating Brackets API Docs page](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Generating-Brackets-API-Docs) for how to update docs to be loaded to http://brackets.io/docs/current.
