This is a clustering of medium priority issues (as of early October 2013) so that we can consider fixing a collection of these as a "make X better" story. Generally, we can be more efficient if we fix several bugs in the same area because the programmers/reviewers can "swap in" the context needed to do work in that area without bouncing around between bugs in unrelated parts of Brackets.
