Brackets is applying to participate in [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) during the summer of 2013! This page details some potential projects, and will be updated periodically as the application process progresses.

Students are welcome to propose their own project ideas. However, below are some projects that we think have the right scope: they're reasonable to complete in a summer, they're relatively decoupled from other parts of the system, and they have the potential to be really awesome.

1. **PHP/Ruby/Django/etc. support** -- Add first-class support for developers to work with server-side languages. This could include things like making Live Development work well with server-side templates, adding code completion, and so forth.

2. **New Debugging Interfaces for JavaScript** -- Brackets is currently working with researchers at MIT and Adobe Research on a project called [Theseus](https://github.com/adobe-research/theseus). Theseus endeavors to create new interfaces for debugging event-driven code, and it would be great to have help.

3. **Code Snippets** -- Create new interfaces for allowing users to organize and insert code snippets. One possibility would be to create a system like [Codelets](http://joelbrandt.org/publications/oney_chi2012_codelets.mov)

4. **Brackets on Linux** -- The Linux community has started work on a shell for Brackets, but this effort could use help. This project would primarily focus on writing native C/C++ code for the brackets shell, as well as setting up build and distribution processes for several popular Linux distros.

5. **Brackets on ChromeOS** -- Brackets could make a great code editor for a cloud-based operating system. The majority of this project would likely focus on replacing Brackets' current filesystem with a cloud-based filesystem.

6. **Brackets on a tablet** -- What would it mean to write or debug code on a touch-enabled device? Would it make sense to use a regular computer and a tablet at the same time with Brackets? If so, how would this work?

7. **Something else?** -- Our entire [backlog of features](https://trello.com/board/brackets/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88) is kept on a public Trello board. That's another great place to go to come up with project ideas.
